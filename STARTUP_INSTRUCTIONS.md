TO START ON WINDOWS:

First, you have to enter a python virtual environment. That's just a tool
to make sure things you install for this python project don't interfere with
other python projects. To do this you just type 

		VENV\Scripts\activate

in command prompt.

Then, you need to start up the server. Do this by entering GUI_CODE in command prompt ("cd GUI_CODE"), and then running the python script to start the server

		python flaskTest.py 

Then, open your browser, navigate to localhost:5000, and you're on!
